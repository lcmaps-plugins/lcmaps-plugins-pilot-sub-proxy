.SH DESCRIPTION
This plugin is meant to be used in a very specific pilot job scenario, where the
payload user has no certificate of its own, but the pilot reliably knows the
identity of the payload user.

In order for this plugin to run, the pilot should create one more proxy
delegation encoding the username into the extra CN field of the proxy. This new
payload proxy should be passed into the LCMAPS framework as the normal PEM
string (e.g. for gLExec via the GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT environment variable). The
original pilot proxy should be pointed to by the X509_USER_PROXY.

The plugin will verify (in this order) that
.\" use TP instead of groff specific nr
.TP 3
1.
the pilot proxy contains its private key,
.TP
2.
both the pilot and payload proxy are RFC3820 type proxies,
.TP
3.
both the pilot and payload proxy are limited proxies (unless
\fB\-\-require-limited\fR is set to \fIno\fR),
.TP
4.
at least one of the FQANs matches a specified pattern (when using
\fB\-\-match-fqan\fR),
.TP
5.
the payload proxy is signed by the pilot proxy,
.TP
6.
the effective proxy pathlength contraint for the payload proxy does not exceed
the maximum (normally 0, unless changed with \fB\-\-max-pcpathlen\fR),
.TP
7.
the value of the extra proxy commonName RDN (CN) does not start with a
slash (/).
.PP
If all checks succeed, the plugin will add the value of the extra payload proxy
commonName RDN into the set of LCMAPS credentials as the user_dn. Additionally
it will also add the FQANs of the original proxy to this set of LCMAPS
credentials unless the flag \fB\-\-add-pilot-fqans\fR is set to \fIno\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-\-add-pilot-fqans "{yes|no}
In addition to adding the subject DN of the leaf-payload-proxy, the plugin can
also add the FQANs of the proxy. Default is \fIyes\fR, to add the FQANs.

.TP
.BI "\-\-require-limited "{yes|no}
Specifies whether an extra test is done to check that both proxies are limited.
Default is \fIyes\fR, to do this test.

.TP
.BI "\-\-match-fqan "FQAN-pattern
When specified, at least one of the FQANs needs to match the given pattern. It
is a wildcard supporting matching. E.g. '*/Role=pilot*'. Note that this option
has limited usability unless the client is doing the VOMS verification.

.TP
.BI "\-\-lock-type "{none|flock|fcntl}
Type of locking mechanism used for reading in the pilot proxy pointed to by the
X509_USER_PROXY, default is \fInone\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-\-max-pcpathlen "maximum\ effective\ pcPathLen
Maximum effective proxy pathlength constraint for the leaf payload proxy.
Default is \fI0\fR, i.e. no proxies are allowed after it. Use \fI-1\fR for
infinite. \fBNOTE\fR: under normal circumstances this option should be left to
the default value 0.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.TP
.B LCMAPS_MOD_SUCCESS
Success.
.TP
.B LCMAPS_MOD_FAIL
Failure.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
X509_USER_PROXY
should point to a file containing the proxy of the pilot job user. It should be
a valid RFC3820 compliant proxy.

.SH NOTES
.IP (1) 4
Since this plugin only checks that the payload proxy is signed by the leaf-proxy
of the pilot proxy-chain, it is very important to run first the
lcmaps_verify_proxy.mod which will verify the latter proxy chain.
.IP (2)
Since any user allowed to call gLExec could provide these type of proxies, it is
necessary to verify that the pilot proxy at least has the pilot role.
.IP (3)
When running inside gLExec (typical scenario), it is most probably necessary to
prevent the payload from obtaining the proxy. This can be enforced by the pilot:
export GLEXEC_TARGET_PROXY=/dev/null

.P
A typical invocation in gLExec would be something like
.P
\fC $ create_pilot_sub_proxy.sh User:JohnDoe\fR
.br
\fC $ export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT=${X509_USER_PROXY}_payload\fR
.br
\fC $ export GLEXEC_TARGET_PROXY=/dev/null\fR
